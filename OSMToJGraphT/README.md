This project allows OSM data to be imported into Java and then exported as a DOT format file using the JGraphT API. DOT format files are best laid out and viewed using Graphviz

APIs Required:
1. OSM API - https://github.com/westnordost/osmapi
2. JGraphT API - https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht

To view the DOT files, you'll need Graphviz: https://www.graphviz.org/

An example of the usage is shown in the class APIBasedImportTest.java
The example uses data from Auckland, New Zealand
