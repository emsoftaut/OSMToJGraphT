# OSMToJGraphT

This project allows OSM data to be imported into Java and then exported as a DOT format file using the JGraphT API. DOT format files are best laid out and viewed using Graphviz

APIs Required:

OSM API - https://github.com/westnordost/osmapi
JGraphT API - https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht
To view the DOT files, you'll need Graphviz: https://www.graphviz.org/

An example of the usage is shown in the class APIBasedImportTest.java
